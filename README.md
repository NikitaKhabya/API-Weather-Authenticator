# API-Weather-Authenticator
Hey, so I today in my 100 days of code course, I have tried to build an API Authenticator using the open-weather and twilio APIs. So this takes longitude and latitude as inputs and based on the weather conditions it sends us a message through twilio API if it's going to rain today or not. Look around the code  and set it up for yourself too. Thank you.
